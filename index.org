This is a personal blog. Opinions expressed here do not reflect those
of my employer.


* Most recent articles

I also maintain a [[file:articles.org][full list of articles]], and an [[file:feed.xml][RSS]] feed.

* Favourite articles

These are my three all-time favourite articles.

** [[file:articles/2018/submarine-sonar-hiring.org][My hiring experience as a submarine sonar operator in the Norwegian Navy]] :Talks:Hiring:
#+include: articles/2018/submarine-sonar-hiring.org::abstract :only-contents t

My first to reach the HackerNews front page. In weeks it got orders of
magnitude more hits than the rest of my site put together.

** [[file:articles/2017/potter-coding-dojo.org][Potter Coding Dojo in Clojure]]                                    :Clojure:
#+include: articles/2017/potter-coding-dojo.org::abstract :only-contents t

I like it because of the amount of iterations I went through, and the
discussions I had with coworkers about it at all-hands.

** [[file:articles/2006/rise-of-the-machine.org][Rise of the Machine]]                                                :Hacks:

I like this one because it was such a great learning experience!

* Publications Elsewhere

This is a list of some of my talks & articles hosted elsewhere:

** [[http://web.archive.org/web/20160423082550/http://techblog.net-a-porter.com/author/stig/][My NET-A-PORTER TECHNICAL BLOG entries (2013--2014)]]

These are my contributions to the NET-A-PORTER TECHNICAL BLOG.
Including, but not limited to, a shell & regexp primer, maximising
cache hit rates for REST APIs, and Akka musings.

The original site is no longer online, but the WayBackMachine
remembers.

** [[https://speakerdeck.com/stig/delighting-your-users-with-sbjson-4][Delighting your users with SBJson 4 (2013)]]                   :SpeakerDeck:

This is my first [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha][Pecha Kucha]] style talk, made at NSLondon meetup. The
sound is not great, and one of my slides is a bit misleading.
Nevertheless I have a special fondness for this one. It was the first
time someone I didn't know contacted me to ask me to give a talk.

The video is no longer online, so I've linked to the slides instead.

** [[http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/overcoming-u-turns-and-dead-ends-lessons-of-using-scala-akka-spray-on-heroku][Overcoming U-turns and Dead Ends: Lessons of using Scala, Akka & Spray on Heroku (2013)]]

I presented this "experience talk" at Scala eXchange 2013 with Sam
Dean. (I'm afraid you have to log in to view the video.) It's a
mish-mash of stuff we learnt while building the backend of The
Netbook---NET-A-PORTER's social network offering.

** [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170627125915/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/19/libtap.html][Testing C with Libtap (2006)]]

I gave a talk at YAPC::NA 2005 on this topic, and a member of the
audience approached me to write it up as an article for ONLamp
magazine. This was the result.

Sadly it is no longer online at the original URL, but the
WayBackMachine has my back!

** [[file:files/m4.pdf][Creating HTML with M4 (2002)]]

A long, long time ago I used =make= and =cpp= to maintain my website.
Later I upgraded to =m4=. I wrote an article on the subject, and Linux
Magazine published it.
