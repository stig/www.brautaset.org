I'm Stig Brautaset, a software person on the internet. This is my personal
website, which is mostly [a blog](/articles.html). I am Norwegian but consider
myself Brit*ish*, having lived in England most of my adult life. I moved to
London for university in 2000. 15 years later I've now moved to the English
countryside, near the Scottish border.

I love playing with different languages. Over the years have toyed with C,
Prolog, Perl, Objective-C, Java, Scala & Clojure. Employers have paid me to
write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Scala and English.

I have profiles on many places across the web, in various states of lacking
attention, including these:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stigbra)
* [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stigbrautaset)
* [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/stigbra)
* [Masterbranch](http://www.masterbranch.com/developer/stig.brautaset)

About SBJson
------------

I wrote [SBJson][], a popular JSON parser & generator for Objective-C. You are
welcome to use it&mdash;and any other project available from my
[Github profile][github]&mdash;for free, as long as you adhere to their
respective licenses.

In most cases the license requires that you have to attribute me in your
application. I understand that this attribution requirement can sometimes be a
problem. If you let me know about the problem, I may agree to grant you an
alternative license.
