Nadia and I went to the Northgate, on the corner Northchurch road and Southgate road, to
celebrate the smoking ban finally kicking in across England. It is not a moment too soon,
and we've been looking forward to it for ages.

Nadia had roast whole plaice with baby vegetables and champagne sauce, while I went for
halibut with lentils and green beans. Nadia found the plaice a bit bland and undercooked,
while I really enjoyed the halibut. It was dry in places and juicy in others, but very
tasty all the way through.

For dessert Nadia had chocolate grand marnier truffles with vanilla cream, while I had
vanilla panacotta with a berry compote. We ended up eating about half of each other's, and
we found that the dishes were a *fantastic* mix.

One downside was that they've stopped doing Peetermans, but this was compensated a bit by
me finding out that they had both Fr&uuml;li and Kriek&mdash;albeit bottled.
