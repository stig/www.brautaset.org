title: Attacks on London

A big *thank you* to everyone who sent email, sms or picked up the phone to ask if I am
ok; it has been a humbling experience.

The attacks happened far from where I live, but several of them happened within 10 minutes
walk from where I work. I was, as so many others, on my way in to work when the attacks
took place. I had jumped on a Circle line train at Baker Street and was heading for
Barbican. My train was held for about half an hour just outside Farringdon, where it was
pulled out of service when it finally arrived. We were not told what was going on, I guess
they did not know at that point, and I was cursing London Underground all the way on my
extended walk into the office.

I now count myself lucky. I came away unharmed, and so, I think, did all of my friends. My
condolences to the family and friends of those who did not. Let us make a toast to the
terrorists who did this: *May the worst day of your past be the best of your future.*.
