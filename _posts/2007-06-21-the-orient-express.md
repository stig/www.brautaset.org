Today Nadia and I took her parents on a day-trip to Folkstone on the <a href="http://www.orient-express.com/web/luxury/trains_cruises/journey_planner_uk.jsp">Orient Express</a>. We left Victoria at about 11:30 and had a delicious <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/skugg/582701275">three course lunch</a> on the way down. The <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/skugg/583042524/">main course</a>, in particular, was fantastic.

The train in itself was an experience. It consisted exclusively of British Pullman carriages; ours was the Ibis, built in 1925. We had our own compartment, and people in white uniforms falling over themselves to make sure we had a comfortable journey.

Even the *toilet* was spacious, and came complete with a huge marble sink and naked lady mosaic flooring. I also liked that it had honest-to-god coat-hangers so you could hang your coat up properly whilst riding the porcelain bus. None of those pert knobs on the wall that leaves your jacket a funny shape afterwards. Oh, no.

As we arrived at Folkstone Harbour Band a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/skugg/583046980/">four-piece band</a> started playing 1920's music. Well, it sounded like 1920's music to me, at least. They were jolly, and pretty good, and added a *great* atmosphere.

We were taken by bus up to Grand and Metropole hotels, where we spent a good 80 minutes stretching our legs trotting around the grounds and lounging in the bar. Nadia and I also had a good laugh at a Japanese woman with one of the weirdest head-garments I've ever seen. It looked like she'd super-glued half a surf-board to her forehead. It was *hilarious*. I wish I managed to get a picture of it, but I was laughing too hard.

We left an hour late from Folkstone, but the driver managed to rein in about three quarters of that, making our homeward trip a little bouncier than I'd liked. It meant that if we filled our tea-cups more than one third up, they *would* spill if we didn't hold on to them all the time. Other than that, the sandwiches, scones, clotted cream, jam, and cakes were all wonderful.
