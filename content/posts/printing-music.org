#+title: Printing Music

In this day of 3D printing it's interesting to think about what can be
printed in the future.  In *this* post, however, I'll attempt regale you
with what I have been able to print in the past.  Nearly two decades
ago I set up a service to print music--and I don't mean sheet music,
but audible music played through my stereo.

I was using Linux and wanted to set up a networked music jukebox for
playing MP3s and Ogg Vorbis files, but couldn't find any software to
do that.  (That I liked, anyway.)  I seem to remember that with the
best Linux-based player it was possible to list music to "play next",
but that added things to the /top/ of the playlist rather than at the
bottom of the queue. It was also only usable locally.

Enter the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Printer_Daemon_protocol][Line Printer Daemon]]. This manages a queue of files for
printing. You can use the =lpr= utility (it's what I used) to queue
files to be printed, or to alter a previously submitted request.  It's
also networked, and provides an admin with the ability to manage the
queue.  (For example deleting repeated jobs.)  I ended up writing =lpd=
configuration and a few lines of shell script that acted as a printer.
This "printer" would read files off the print queue and use
MPlayer[fn:1] to "print" them[fn:2].  Voilá!  I and other users[fn:3]
could now "print" music through my stereo.

I remember trying a different app first, but MPlayer's edge was that
it introspected the byte stream to detect the file type, rather than
rely on file name suffix.  This meant it was able to handle situations
where music was /piped in/ rather than provided in a named file.  (It
also handled cases where =.mp3= files had been labelled as =.ogg= so its
owner could appear cool.)

* Disclaimer

This transpired so long ago (1998-99) that I don't remember all the
details.  I cannot even remember whether it was my own invention or if
I got the idea from someone else.  Nevertheless it was a fun
experiment at the time.

My endeavours was before the initial release of Common UNIX Printing
System (CUPS) and its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS#Filter_system][filter system]] but it looks like it should be
possible to do the same with that as I did back then.  (And possibly
rather a lot simpler too!)

* Thanks

Thanks to [[https://www.doismellburning.co.uk/][Kristian Glass]] for reviewing a draft of this article. (And
requesting that I write the post in the first place, after it came up
in a conversation on Slack.)

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Now probably known as [[http://mplayerx.org][MPlayerX]]? I haven't really kept up...

[fn:2] I.e. play music.

[fn:3] I /say/ other users, but I was the only Linux user in my halls of
residence and no one else ever used it.

* Abstract                                                         :noexport:

I explain how I set up MPlayer as a printer driver so I could add a
distributed print queue for music. (AKA a JukeBox.)
