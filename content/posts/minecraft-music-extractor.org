#+title: Extracting Minecraft Music with Python

My son loves Minecraft. (Witness the evidence from his [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPr6gDj4kVYoLJGIR-2YIw][YouTube
channel]].) He even loves the /music/ of Minecraft, particularly the music
during the credits in the 1.13 version; and will sometimes put on the
credits to listen. We wanted to be able to play this music at his
upcoming birthday party, without having to bring a computer and have
Minecraft running.

My wife found [[https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory][a tutorial]] for extracting the music, but we couldn't get
the example code to run on our Macs. /However/, I could understand what
it was trying to do sufficiently to write my own version. I decided to
write it in Python, because parsing JSON with =grep= offends my
sensibilites[fn::That, and my wife's computer doesn't have [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]]
installed.]. I'm not a Python expert though, so please don't use this
as an example of how you should write Python!

Through this I learnt about how Minecraft stores its assets. The core
idea (for our purpose, anyway) is that each Minecraft version has an
/index/ file containing a list of all its assets, and their SHA1
~hash~ and their size. Here is an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
    {
      "objects": {
	"icons/icon_16x16.png": {
	  "hash": "bdf48ef6b5d0d23bbb02e17d04865216179f510a",
	  "size": 3665
	},
	"minecraft/sounds/music/game/water/axolotl.ogg": {
	  "hash": "ee92e4ed79b3c4c47eabe71b36375b5d3f05b017",
	  "size": 10423856
	}
      }
    }
#+END_SRC

These hashes attached to the asset names corresponds to file names in
the =objects= directory, which is the asset we want. The names are the
SHA1 hash of their contents. This is pretty neat, and allows Minecraft
to store assets for multiple versions efficiently. If an asset changes
from one version to the next, only the checksum in that version's
index file needs to change, and the corresponding object added to the
=objects= directory.

We wanted music from the most recent Minecraft version. To avoid
having to edit the script (or make it take arguments) whenever we
install an update, I decided to make the script automatically find the
most recent version. It does that by listing all the indices files
(line [[(indices)]]), sort the list, and take the most recent (line
[[(index)]]).

To play it safe, we wanted to be able to run the script multiple times
without things breaking or overwriting previously extracted music. To
do this I put the music files in a versioned directory under
=~/Music/Minecraft=. I removed the file extension (i.e. the =.json= bit)
from the index filename, and used that as the version number (see line
[[(noext)]]).

We were only interested in music, and like the existing script only
extracted all the assets with "music" in their name. We also wanted to
keep the context provided by the full asset name. (It's not
immediately obvious to me that "axolotl" has to do with water.)  This
means I had to create the full directory path to the extracted file,
however, which I do at line [[(makedirs)]]. We have to check if the
directory already exists first, otherwise the ~os.makedirs~ function
throws an exception[fn::I don't know if the Pythonic way would be to
just try it, and catch the exception.].

The ~find~ (line [[(find)]]) function[fn::I found this on Stack Overflow, I
think.] iterates over all the files and directories under the
directory in its first argument, and returns the full path if it finds
a file whose name matches the second argument. In our case we pass it
the assets directory and the object hash, see line [[(asset_path)]].

The full code is below.

#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -r
  #!/usr/bin/env python
  import os
  import json
  from shutil import copyfile

  # This is where vanilla Minecraft stores its assets
  assets_path = os.path.expanduser( (ref:assets)
     "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/assets")

  indices_dir = os.path.join(assets_path, "indexes")
  indices = os.listdir(indices_dir) (ref:indices)
  index_file = sorted(indices)[-1] (ref:index)
  index_path = os.path.join(indices_dir, index_file)

  version, _ = os.path.splitext(index_file) (ref:noext)
  output_dir = os.path.expanduser(
      "~/Music/Minecraft/%s/" % version)

  with open(index_path, "r") as read_file:
      objects = json.load(read_file)["objects"]

  def find(name, path): (ref:find)
      for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
	  if name in files:
	      os.path.join(root, name)

  for k in objects:
      if "music" in k:
	  asset_path = find(objects[k]["hash"], assets_path) (ref:asset_path)
	  outfile = os.path.join(output_dir, k)
	  print("Extracting %s..." % outfile)

	  if not os.path.exists(os.path.dirname(outfile)):
	      os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(outfile)) (ref:makedirs)
	  copyfile(asset_path, outfile)
#+END_SRC

There you have it! You can use this on macOS to extract the music from
Vanilla Minecraft[fn::I know from first-hand experience that it does
not work if you use the [[https://multimc.org][MultiMC launcher]].]. One improvement I
considered, but ultimately decided was not needed (yet) was the
ability to specify which version to extract the music from, and the
directory to extract the music /to/.

I create a Python script to extract music files from Minecraft's assets.
