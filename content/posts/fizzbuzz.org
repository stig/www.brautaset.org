The FizzBuzz interview question has been going around a while. If for
some reason you're not familiar with it, here's one wording of it:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For numbers
divisible by three print "fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers
divisible by five print "buzz". For numbers which are divisible by
both three and five print "fizzbuzz".
#+END_QUOTE

Solutions using loops, recursion, if and switch statements abound. But
here's my (hopefully) novel solution to this problem. It uses sed an
xargs and runs in a Unix shell. It is tweetable (i.e. less than 140
chars) and uses no conditionals:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
seq 5 5 100 | xargs -IX echo "Xs/[0-9]*/buzz/" > f
seq 3 3 100 | xargs -IX echo "Xs/[0-9]*/fizz/" >> f
seq 1 100 | sed -f f
#+END_SRC

Here's how it works:

1. The first line creates sed commands to replace zero or more digits
   on every 5th line with the word "buzz"
2. The second line creates sed commands to replace zero or more digits
   on every 3rd line with the word "fizz"
3. The 3rd line creates a list of numbers from 1 to 100 (the seq 1 100
   part) and runs all the sed commands over each that, in order.

How does 15 become "fizzbuzz" though? The trick is in the "zero or
more digits" part. First sed runs 15s/[0-9]*/buzz/ which replaces all
the digits with "buzz". Then sed runs 15s/[0-9]*/fizz/ which replaces
the zero-length string of no digits with "fizz" but without removing
the word "buzz".

The resulting output looks like this:

#+END_EXAMPLE

Addendum: Is this really a valid fizzbuzz solution? You tell me! It
conforms to the spec, but the program doesn't really look at the
values 1 to 100 on each line. Instead of the values on each line, it
works with the positions of the lines.
