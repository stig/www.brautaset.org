#+title: Publishing this blog to an S3 bucket
#+date: <2017-07-23 Sun>
#+category: S3

This is a short post adding to the testing notes from the [[file:s3-website-with-https-using-cloudformation.org::#testing][previous
post]] where I created an S3 bucket to host my static site. To test that
it worked I had to upload /something/ and ended up doing most of what I
had intended for this blog post. If you're reading my [[file:adding-ssl.org][adding SSL
series]] but are only interested in the CloudFormation bits you can skip
this post as it doesn't contain any.

For the tests in my previous post I relied on all =.html= pages being
generated in the same base directory as their sources. But as I don't
intend to check in the generated files, I don't want to continue that!
Instead I want the generated files to end up in =~/public_html= on my
machine, so I can preview them. I intend to do much like what I do
now: =cd= into the root directory containing the generated blog and
issue the command ~python -m SimpleHTTPServer~.

So, I have to change my publishing setup. For the processing of the
Org files I just have to change the =:publishing-directory= setting from
=~/blog= to =~/public_html= but I have to add a new project to deal with
static files. This project looks like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-publish-project-alist
        '(("superloopy_static"
           :base-directory "~/blog"
           :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
           :base-extension "css\\|jpg\\|png\\|pdf"
           :recursive t
           :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
          ("superloopy_html"
           ...)
#+END_SRC

Now, after I have reviewed the changes to the generated files (by
browsing to http://127.0.0.1:8000) I have to upload the generated
files to S3. This is similar to how I uploaded the test files in the
previous post, but now that the directory only contains generated
files I can shorten it to make the =--exclude= line more specific and
contain fewer =--include= lines. My =upload.fish= script looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
#!/usr/local/bin/fish

set -gx AWS_PROFILE stig
aws s3 sync \
    --acl public-read \
    --exclude '.DS_Store' \
    ~/public_html/ s3://www.superloopy.io
#+END_SRC

* Abstract                                                         :noexport:

I show briefly the changes I need to make to publish this blog to S3
rather than to GitHub.
