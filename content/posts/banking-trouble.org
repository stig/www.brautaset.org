#+title: Co-operative Banking Trouble

And here I was thinking the people I currently bank with are
incompetent. Turns out that the [[http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk/][Co-operative bank]] aren't much better.
Okay, so they have have a website that works in non-IE browsers, and
you can call them 24/7 and talk to a person. However, because of their
absolutely hopeless processing of my application for an account, I
won't be banking with them.

I started out in late January, going to their branch in Islington High
street to apply for an account (I went into the branch so I could show
them my proofs of address and identity in person -- I don't feel
comfortable sending away original documents). The first problem I had
was that the branch /wasn't there/. I called them up again, and they
confirmed that the branch was at 1 Islington High street, which was
obviously not true. I later found the branch a few hundred yards down
the road.

Anyway, I wasn't going to let details like that to stop me. I went in to
apply for an account and was taken care of by a pleasant clerk. After
keying in my application he took copies of my details which we both
signed. Then he went to fax them over to the head office, and when he
returned I headed off to a GLLUG meeting, quite pleased with how
painless it had been.

I didn't hear anything from the bank for weeks, so I called them up to
get a status report. They said they were waiting for my proof of address
and identity. I don't know how it happened, but somehow the head office
never got my details. Or so they said, and blamed the branch for losing
them.

I'm not easily put off, so I decided to give them another chance. By now
my application had timed out, so they had to duplicate it. This was easy
enough; they could do that on the phone. Now I only had to go and flash
my details again. For this I went to their branch in Watford. First
impression was better than for the Islington one; at least it's located
where they say it is.

The lady I met there was very apologetic, was understanding when I said
that this time I wanted to wait until I got the confirmation that the
fax were sent before I left. She understood that I wanted this, she
said, but then she said that their fax service wasn't operational on
weekends. This struck me as incredibly weird, but who am I to argue. I
got her personal number so I could call on if there was any trouble.

This far so good; when I called their telephone service on the following
Tuesday they had received the fax with my details. They were currently
waiting to be processed by the team that did that kind of thing. Fine.

Then, yesterday I got a letter saying this (errors and all):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We still need to see confirmation of your proof of identity. Please
  send us 1 original documents issued within the last three months, from
  different companies, from the list below.

  a Bank, building society, credit union, credit card
  statements@@html:<br>@@ b Payslip from current employer
#+END_QUOTE

By now I was really annoyed. This wasn't lessened when I called them up
to query them about it; turned out the application number they had
quoted me on this last letter /was not my application number/ but
belonged to someone else. OK, I thought, this was the drop; now I'm
furious. Mixing up my details with someone else's is not to be taken
lightly when done by a bank. I decided to not bank with them.

However, being royally pissed off I still wanted to find out what on
earth they thought was wrong with my details, as I had brought much more
information than they asked for in the first place, including (but not
limited to): Passport, payslips, bank statements, drivers license,
utility bill & letter from the tax office. They said that because my
passport was Norwegian, they couldn't use it, and they therefore had
only three pieces of id. They were adamant that they'd only received
four pieces, so I can only assume that the female clerk got tired of
feeding my copies through the fax and omitted ones she thought were not
important.

Phew. I really needed to blow off a bit of steam; this ordeal really got
me worked up.

In which I regale you with my attempt to get a current account with
the Co-operative bank.
