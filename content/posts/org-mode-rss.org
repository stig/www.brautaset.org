#+title: Creating an RSS feed with Org mode

For a while I've been wanting to add RSS to this site. Not so much
because I think the site really needs it, but because it intrigued me
to figure out to do it using my existing [[file:blogging-with-org-mode.org][Emacs Org blogging solution]].

In short, I use ~ox-rss.el~ (from Org mode's contrib) to produce an
RSS feed from the [[file:~/blog/content/index.org][home]] page. I was delighted that tags on headlines
were automatically translated into RSS Categories, with no extra work
from me. However, I had to jump some hoops to generate a valid and
useful feed.

*Only /top-level/ headings become items in the RSS feed.*
I had to change the headings I used in my index page to get rid of my
old top-level headings containing dividing my full list of post into
their publication year. Not a big loss, I think, as the URL of each
post contains the year already.

*I wanted the RSS feed to link to the full article page.*
To link to the actual post from the RSS feed I had to add
=RSS_PERMALINK= entries to each of the headings in the index page. One
slightly annoying bit about this is that I can't use the =.org=
extension like everywhere else, I have to change it to the =.html=
extension it will be when published.

*No paragraph content is allowed before the entries.*
Thirdly, the issue of my index page's introductory text not being
allowed in RSS. Solving this was a bit tricky, but I know that Org has
a way to tag sections with =:noexport:= to omit it from being included,
and with a bit of searching I found a promising [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/7578][Emacs StackExchange
Answer]] with a macro I was able to adapt to my use. (The macro should
be all on one line, but I added line breaks for readability.)

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+MACRO: no-rss (eval
   (if
    (org-export-derived-backend-p
     org-export-current-backend 'rss)
     "* COMMENT :noexport:"
     ""))

  {{{no-rss}}}
  I'm Stig Brautaset.  [...]
#+END_SRC

What's happening here is that the macro ={{{no-rss}}}=, when the =rss=
export backend is working on this file, will expand to the headline =*
COMMENT :noexport:= thus making sure that paragraph does not end up in
the RSS feed. I have a separate keyword in the file to provide the
alternative description (and RSS Image URL) for the feed. That looks
like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+RSS_IMAGE_URL: https://www.brautaset.org/etc/icon.png
  ,#+DESCRIPTION: I'm Stig Brautaset, and this is my site's RSS feed.
#+END_SRC

*Getting the publication dates right.*
Getting the publication dates right was just a case of applying elbow
grease. To do so all I had to do was to update the =PUBDATE= property
for each entry in the index page to that of the blog post in question.
Since I don't have all that many articles this wasn't too difficult.
For future posts I'll let =ox-rss= generate the =PUBDATE= properties,
since adding them to the index will effectively publish them.

*Conclusion.*
So there you go! I think this was all I had to contend with to produce
an RSS feed from this blog. I hope you enjoyed this post!  It ended up
a bit longer than I expected, but there you go.

A post to announce that this site now has an RSS feed generated from
the front page's content, and explain how I create it.
