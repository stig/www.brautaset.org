I'll first review my 2019 goals, then cover goals for 2020, before
finally give an overview of my current practice routine.

* 2019 goals vs reality

I ticked fewer than half the boxes on my list of 2019 goals:

1. [ ] Jam with other people at least six times
2. [X] Start and complete Justin's "Green" grade
3. [ ] Record myself playing once a month to track progress
4. [ ] Learn 10 new songs
5. [ ] Stretch goal: complete Justin's "Blue" grade
6. [X] Stretch goal/treat: start building a pedal board


I found the recording really distracting, and quickly got frustrated
that the transcribing of the songs took too much time away from the
guitar. This was the most visible (and painful) failure.

That said, I am really happy with my progress overall. It just wasn't
on the arbitrary goals I've set myself at the start of the year! For
example, I established good practice habits by:

- Keeping a practice journal, which has helped me track progress and
  focus my practice effort

- Buying Justin Sandercoe's [[https://thejustinguitarstore.com/collections/books/products/the-justinguitar-rhythm-reading-for-guitarists-book][Rhythm Reading]] and working hard on that
  for 7 months, as I struggled keeping and /working out/ rhythms

- Started learning to read music, using Frederick Noad's [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Solo-Guitar-Playing-Fourth-Gtr/dp/0825636795/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=80607977866938&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=noad+solo+guitar+playing&qid=1581024624&sr=8-1][Solo Guitar
  Playing]]

- Working on ear training, and basics like learning the names of notes
  on the fret board


The ear training has really paid off. I have noticed that it's /much/
easier now to work out songs by ear. Sometimes it falls into place
without me even trying!

Likewise, the rhythm practice has paid off handsomely. A couple years
ago I couldn't even play to a metronome. Now my rhythm doesn't
completely derail in the absence of a metronome.

I ticked the "start building a pedal board", as I bought my first
effects pedal: a Tube Screamer mini. This to make it easier to
practice soloing over a chord progression. It sounds /soo/ good with
my Yamaha THR 10 amp. I love it!

I also bought a travel guitar, aiming to take it places and jam with
other people. Unfortunately it didn't [[https://konmari.com/][spark joy]], so I traded it in
(along with my son's unused drum kit) for a Faith Earth Legacy
acoustic. It is amazing, and is my primary guitar now.

* My goals for 2020

I'm currently reading /Atomic Habits/, and one of the first things
covered is that outcome-oriented goals are a poor idea. If you instead
change how you /identify/, the good habits should come more naturally. I
think I have had some success with this already: at some point I
started identifying as a /guitarist/, rather than /someone who wants to
learn to play guitar/. Perhaps that's why practising an hour every day
hasn't felt like a slog at all---I've really enjoyed it and look
forward to it every day.

So, goals for 2020 are going to be process oriented rather than goal
oriented:

- Continue keeping a practice journal :: Rather than the dead-tree
  book I used last year I'm going to use Justin's practice assistant
  app, free from [[https://www.justinguitar.com][his website]] for registered users. I like that it has
  built-in timers, metronome, and keeps track of stats so I can track
  improvements & practice time.

- Aim for at least 1 hour of dedicated practice a day :: I don't own a
  guitar I'm happy to take travelling, and I don't travel enough that
  I can justify getting one, so I'm going to qualify this with /unless
  I'm travelling/.

- Regularly record myself playing and listen critically :: The goal
  here is to determine where I need to focus my practice. Producing
  high quality or long-lived recordings is not part of this goal:
  using my phone's voice recorder app is fine.

- Adapt my practice schedule to keep it fun and relevant :: Being a
  guitarist is who I /am/ now, but there's no point in keeping to a
  practice schedule if I don't get enjoyment from it.

- Seek out opportunities to make music with other people :: This could
  mean playing simple songs with someone else singing, playing known
  songs with other people on instruments, or all-out jamming. I've
  really enjoyed playing with others when I've had the opportunity,
  and it's motivated me to learn more songs.

- Try to work songwriting into my regular practice :: I have been
  noodling around with some chord progressions slowly coalescing into
  a song for months, if not a year. I've not gone about it in a
  structured way, however: it's mainly been taking shape during my
  "play" sessions, rather than my "practice" ones.


So, these are my musical goals for the year. I'm hoping that if I keep
working on the basics, and building good practice habits, I'll
eventually reap compound interest and become a good musician. In the
words of [[https://www.azquotes.com/quote/650861][Benjamin Franklin]]:

* A snapshot of my practice schedule

To round off this post, let me share a snapshot of my current practice
schedule, and how I go about it[fn::/Atomic Habits/ points to research
that shows that people who are asked to detail /how/ they're going to
change their habits are more likely to do so.]. I usually do the first
three while pottering around in the kitchen & making coffee, before
getting my guitar out for the rest.

| Mins | Exercise                                                   | Metronome |
|------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------|
|    3 | /Find the Note/ exercise in Justin's /Guitar Note Trainer/ app |           |
|    3 | /Name the Note/ exercise in Justin's /Guitar Note Trainer/ app |           |
|    5 | Aural Interval Training with Justin's /Ear Trainer/ app      |           |
|    5 | "Old Faithful" strumming & changing chords mid-bar         | 84 bpm    |
|   10 | Rhythm Reading: playing major scale in G to exercise 4.3   | 66 bpm    |
|   10 | Solo Guitar Playing                                        | 54 bpm    |
|    5 | Picking the intro to /Behind Blue Eyes/                      | 80 bpm    |
|    5 | Triad Arpeggios in A Major                                 | 96 bpm    |
|    5 | Picking the verse of /Behind Blue Eyes/                      | 40 bpm    |
|   10 | Playing the verse of /Nothing Else Matters/ with a pick      | 76 bpm    |

The "Old Faithful" strumming exercise acts partly as a warm-up, before
I tackle the most mentally challenging parts: rhythm reading and note
reading.

Some days I get through the full routine before the rest of my family
wakes up. Occasionally I get distracted and manage nothing. /Most/ days,
however, I manage a good chunk of my practice routine in the morning.
* Abstract                                                         :noexport:

I review how I did on my musical goals for 2019, and try to outline
some new goals for 2020, before rounding off with sharing a snapshot
of my current practice routine.
