*Note:* This post has been updated to reflect the contents of
=/usr/share/dict/words= on OS X Mountain Lion, and use egrep rather than
Perl.

A friend mentioned that the word "bookkeeping" was (apparently) the
only English word that had three consecutive groups of double letters
in it. I decided to test this statement, so I wrote a little regular
expression to verify it. Here's the program, and the results of
running it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
egrep '(.)\1(.)\2(.)\3' /usr/share/dict/words
#+END_SRC

: bookkeeper
: bookkeeping
: subbookkeeper


So, it turned out he was right. (At the time this post was written, he
was; subbookkeeper was added later, and I'll allow bookkeeping as
a variant of bookkeeper.) Then I got curious; what if the groups don't
have to be consecutive? That's easy enough to check, so let's do that:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
egrep '(.)\1.*(.)\2.*(.)\3' /usr/share/dict/words | wc -l
#+END_SRC

: 170

Wow. I wonder if any of those have *four* groups of double letters in
them? (Non consecutive?)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
egrep '(.)\1.*(.)\2.*(.)\3.*(.)\4' /usr/share/dict/words
#+END_SRC

: killeekillee
: possessionlessness
: subbookkeeper
: successlessness

Those sure are some funny words...

#  LocalWords:  subbookkeeper wc killeekillee
#  LocalWords:  possessionlessness successlessness
