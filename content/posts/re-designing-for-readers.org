#+title: Re-designing for readers
#+date: <2013-06-15>

I enjoyed reading Matt Gemmell's post on [[https://web.archive.org/web/20140103002822/http://mattgemmell.com/designing-blogs-for-readers][designing blogs for readers]]
the other week. I decided to see how well my own blog "complies" to
his advice.

I have had blogs on WordPress, Tumblr and writing my own (terrible)
blog software on a rented VM in the past. This site is a clean break
from those. Content & code both lives in a git repository, which
appeals immensely to me as a programmer, and the site is statically
generated and hosted on GitHub. I don't get the statistics that
WordPress gives you, and I don't have the seamless posting from
Tumblr, but I have full control of the templates & content, and free
custom domains.

A lot of blogs seems to focus on style over substance---or at least they
make it seem that way---with themes that make it very hard to read the
text. Garish background colours; a dazzle of columns; tiny fonts; or, my
current pet peeve, light grey text on white background. These all amount
to punching your readers in the face, and I wanted to avoid that. Thus
this site has a single-column layout, high-contrast theme with fairly
large font size. But my front page wasn't quite right.

Instead of the "about me" blurb I used to have I followed Matt's advice
and created a new front page that contains excerpts of the ten most
recent posts. This was made possible by upgrading Jekyll (my blogging
platform) to a new version that automatically grabs the first paragraph
of each post to use for the excerpt. The old front page became the
[[file:../about.org][About]] page instead. Better!

The font was already "big enough", I feel, but I shrank the line length
slightly.

/Update 2013-06-17:/ According to Google Analytics the bounce rate
dropped by 15--20% when the change to the homepage went out. Average
visitor duration went up by about 50%, and average number of pages per
visit went up from below 3 to nearly 4. Not a bad result at all!
