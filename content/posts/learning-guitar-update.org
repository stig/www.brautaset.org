I [[file:musical-goals-january-update.org][hoped to do these posts]] monthly, but that went south. Thankfully
I've done a lot better when it comes to keeping up with my practice!
Here's a quick recap of my goals to complete by July 2019.

| 7. |       | Research how to record myself on video         |


I had not only bought a new travel guitar, but even a new travel amp!
I've gone to one local beginners' jam session, and was expecting to
jam with colleagues at a work trip but unfortunately something came up
last moment and I couldn't go. The local jam sessions happen every
week, however, so I should still be able to meet this goal.

As for finishing Justin's beginner/consolidation modules and the
"Green" grade, I'm just putting finishing touches on [[https://www.justinguitar.com/site-map-and-lesson-structure][Intermediate
Foundation 2]], having covered the Effective Practice and Intermediate
Foundation 1 modules previously in the year. So, doing well on that
score.

As for learning 5 new songs, I've got three AC/DC songs I can play
along to. For two of them I can do a passable solo. I've also been
practising /Layla (Unplugged)/ by Clapton and /The House of the Rising
Sun/ by The Animals. They're not entirely new to me, but I wasn't happy
with my performance previously. Now I'm getting to a point where I can
sing and play at the same time.

I'm not yet a looper pedal expert, but I have been using it more to
lay down simple chord progressions to practice soloing over. I'm a lot
better at keeping a steady beat and getting the loop to transition
seamlessly. I would use it more, but it uses up a lot of batteries, so
I think one of my next purchases will have to be a power supply so I
can keep it permanently plugged in.

I haven't really done much with regards to recording video. For now
I'm satisfied sticking to audio, since I'm really just tracking
progress rather than entertaining others.

* Transcribing & Recording to Track Progress

  My yearly goals list [[file:musical-goals-for-2019.org][record myself once a month to track progress]].
  On this I have not done as well as I had hoped. Partly this is
  because I try to keep my computer and guitar practice separate, as
  the computer is too distracting. Nevertheless, I have managed to do
  a couple more recordings since January.

  In February i transcribed and recorded [[https://soundcloud.com/user-100088275/touch-too-much/s-OFUfW#t=2:20][Touch Too Much]] ([[file:learning-guitar-update/Touch_Too_Much.pdf][PDF]]). This is
  one of my favourite AC/DC songs. I am particularly proud of
  transcribing the full song on my own, including the little solo in
  the recording. I'm sad that it's difficult to play along to the
  original of this one, as it's "not in a standard tuning". (*Cough.*)

  In March I attempted to transcribe and record [[https://soundcloud.com/user-100088275/for-those-about-to-rock-we/s-AtRIb#t=0:07][For Those About To
  Rock (We Salute You)]] ([[file:learning-guitar-update/For_Those_About_To_Rock.pdf][PDF]]). This was /much/ harder, for a combination
  of factors. The rhythm in the riffs, particularly the intro, was
  more subtle and varied than I expected; there are sections where no
  instruments are playing; the beat changes from about 126 to 140+
  BPMs before slowing down again; and a large section of the song has
  all the instruments playing so loud it's hard to discern beats. All
  of these factors made it hard to determine where bars start and end.

  As a consequence I've soured a bit on doing these thorough
  transcriptions, and haven't done any since mid April. I'm still
  trying to decide what to do about it. Maybe doing some lighter
  transcriptions, essentially producing "lead sheets", with just
  lyrics and rhythm chords, and perhaps general strumming rhythm, is
  the way to go.

** A note on Lilypond

   This is the program I've used for producing the PDFs of the songs
   above. It produces /beautiful/ output for the rhythm parts. However,
   it doesn't really support guitar bends so I struggle to represent
   lot of the solo parts using it. There have been multiple attempts
   at adding this functionality over the years, but nothing has landed
   in the official distribution as far as I can tell. This makes me
   sad, and I wonder if I need to look around for a different tool for
   transcribing solos.

* On Keeping A Goal Journal

  My Goal Journal, which I've kept since January, is probably my most
  effective practice tool. This was an advice I found in /The Inner
  Game of Music/. This lets me stay honest, and also ensure that I
  practice /with intent/.

  [[file:learning-guitar-update/week-8.jpg][file:learning-guitar-update/week-8-preview.jpg]]

  I started out writing out individual days, using about 3 pages per
  week. It was inefficient, both in terms of paper and time use.

  By week 13 I had structured & economised my journal entries better,
  and each week fit on one page. Having more consistency of practice
  day to day I saw more progress too.

  By week 17 my journal had improved a bit more, simplifying the
  "done" marks and sometimes using numbers rather than ticks to record
  progress. Previously I recorded PBs on a separate sheet taped to the
  wall next to my guitar, but I prefer to have it all in one place.

* Conclusion

  While not as far as I had hoped with the transcribing (and
  recording) I am happy with my progress, and think I'm on track for
  completing my goals for the year. More importantly, practising is
  becoming more enjoyable and it's getting a lot easier to pick up new
  songs.

  I probably need to go back to an earlier module and put more work
  into playing different strumming patterns, and getting my foot
  stomping along to those. I only started to put effort into that in
  April (according to my journal) and I have seen so much progress.

I try to keep myself honest--and on target!--by posting an update on
my guitar learning journey.
