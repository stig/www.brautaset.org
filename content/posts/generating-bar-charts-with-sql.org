[[http://jerakeen.org][jerakeen]] pointed me to a post showing how you could [[http://www.squarebits.com/blog/2006/11/generate_simple.html][Generate Simple
Bar Charts From a MySQL Prompt]]. It's a neat trick for quickly getting
a feel for the distribution of values in a database. The post is MySQL
centric, but you can do the same thing in any database. PostgreSQL's
=REPEAT= is very particular about being passed an INT, however, so you
may have to cast the second argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  SELECT foo_id, REPEAT('#', COUNT(*)::INT)
  FROM bar
  GROUP BY 1;
#+END_SRC
