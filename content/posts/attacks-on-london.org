#+title: Attacks on London
#+date: <2005-07-09>

A big /thank you/ to everyone who sent email, SMS or picked up the phone
to ask if I am OK; it has been a humbling experience.

The attacks happened far from where I live, but several of them happened
within 10 minutes walk from where I work. I was, as so many others, on
my way in to work when the attacks took place. I had jumped on a Circle
line train at Baker Street and was heading for Barbican. My train was
held for about half an hour just outside Farringdon, where it was pulled
out of service when it finally arrived. We were not told what was going
on, I guess they did not know at that point, and I was cursing London
Underground all the way on my extended walk into the office.

I now count myself lucky. I came away unharmed, and so, I think, did all
of my friends. My condolences to the family and friends of those who did
not. Let us make a toast to the terrorists who did this: /May the worst
day of your past be the best of your future./.
