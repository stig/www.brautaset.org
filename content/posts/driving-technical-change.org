This is a short book of about 130 pages, divided unevenly into four
parts.

The first part is a brief introduction, with an important message.
Make sure you /solve a problem/, rather than just pushing a solution
looking for a problem. The latter is neutral at best, and usually
detrimental.

Part two is a pattern catalogue of sceptics: The Uninformed, The Herd,
The Cynic, The Burned, The Time Crunched, The Boss, and The
Irrational. I have encountered all in the past. I even am, or have
been, a handful. This was a slightly uncomfortable realisation---but a
valuable one I feel.

The third part is the largest, and contains nine chapters each
describing a technique for dealing with sceptics: Gain Expertise,
Deliver Your Message, Demonstrate Your Technique, Propose Compromise,
Create Trust, Get Publicity, Focus on Synergy, Build a Bridge, and
Create Something Special. Each has a brief section on why it works,
and which types of sceptics it counters. There's nothing particularly
new in this section, and I have used some of the techniques in the
past. Though I think naming and outlining them is useful, and makes it
easier to remember them as discrete tools.

The (brief) fourth part details a strategy for when you have multiple
types of sceptics to convince. Sections include /Ignore the Irrational/,
/Target the Willing/, /Harness the Converted/ and /Sway Management/.

The book would be stronger if it referenced research rather than
anecdotes. I accept this might have been a /Compromise/ to make it more
accessible. Moreover, I'm /Burned/ by multiple ORMs and found the
recurring example of Hibernate adoption grating, but I don't hold this
against the book itself[fn::Because I'm not /Irrational/.].

Overall I enjoyed the book, and will keep it for future reference. You

I review the book /Driving Technical Change/ by Terrence Ryan.
