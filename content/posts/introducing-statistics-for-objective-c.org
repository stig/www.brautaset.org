#+title: Introducing Statistics for Objective-C
#+date: <2008-02-23>
#+category: ObjectiveC

I have just released version 1.0 of [[https://github.com/stig/Statistics][Statistics]]: an Objective-C
Foundation framework inspired by Perl's [[http://search.cpan.org/dist/Statistics-Descriptive/][Statistics::Descriptive]]. By
that I mean it has a similar interface, though is not a straight port.

Straight out of the box this framework provides count; min; max; range;
mindex; maxdex; biased and unbiased variance and standard deviation;
mode; median; percentile; arithmetic, harmonic, and geometric mean; and
frequency distribution, optionally cumulative. In addition you can
return a new statistics object seeded with the same data *but with
outliers discarded*. Perfect if you're interested in the trimmed mean.

The code is released under the BSD license.
