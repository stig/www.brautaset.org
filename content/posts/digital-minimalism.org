My wife borrowed [[http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/][Digital Minimalism]] at our local library, and we both
read it. Living a life supported---but not /lead/---by technology
resonates with me. Technology is not intrinsically good or bad, but we
should carefully evaluate whether every piece of technology you allow
yourself to use enhances your quality of life or not.

Not everything in the book was new to me. I wrote about my [[file:smartphone-addiction.org][smartphone
addiction]] nearly 5 years ago, and although I haven't given up my
smartphone my situation has improved. My phone currently has no:

- Social media apps
- Slack (despite using it at work)
- Mail (yeah, you read that right)
- News app
- Safari[fn::You can't delete Safari, but you can use Screen Time
  settings to hide it.]
- YouTube

This has certainly helped, and I've weaned myself off compulsively
looking at stuff on my phone whenever I'm not at my computer. (E.g.
while brushing my teeth.) I'm even comfortable leaving the house
without my phone. However, it is /not enough/.

Twitter and Facebook still steals my attention when I'm in front of my
computer. I tried paring down the number of people I followed, and
installing browser plugins to remove their worst distractions. I still
found myself compulsively checking the services. I spent more time
than I indented on these services, and I never came away feeling this
time was well spent!

Additionally it's clear by now that Twitter and Facebook are only
interested in maximising your time on the site so they can get your
eyeballs in front of more ads, and damn the consequences. I don't want
to line Dorsey and Zuckerberg's pockets any more.

I deleted my Twitter account last week, and my Google account (used
solely for YouTube) today. I've scheduled my Facebook account deletion
for July 1st. This is the only service I've used to communicate with
wider family and childhood friends, and I wanted to give them a bit of
a heads up before disappearing.

What's next? One of the most distracting habits left is reading news
online. I currently get most of my news from the BBC, but I'm
considering re-subscribing to The Economist. I cancelled because I
never managed to read their entire issue, but I miss their more
in-depth reporting and lack of celebrity worship and single-paragraph
"stories" without any substance.

Essentially, I'm extricating myself from social media and unwanted
digital distractions, bit by bit. For a while I've desperately wanted
more control over where I spend my limited currency in the attention
economy. Reading /Digital Minimalism/ gave me the confidence to take
action.

I introduce Cal Newport's book, and how it's helping me take control
of where I spend my limited currency in today's attention economy.
