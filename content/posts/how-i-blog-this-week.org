#+title: How I Blog (This Week)
#+date: <2016-10-06>
#+category: Org

 I've long used [[http://jekyllrb.com][Jekyll]] to assemble my blog, and Emacs two write all my content
 and templates. I've been wanting to use [[https://github.com/eggcaker/jekyll-org/issues/19][jekyll-org]] to write my blog entries
 directly in Org format, but that is unfortunately not possible yet, in the
 way I want it to work. However, I have found a work-around I am happy with
 for now.

 Recently I've started exploring Org-mode's Capture templates, and I've now
 set up a new template for capturing the outline of a blog post. The template
 is called =tpl-blog-post.org= and lives in my =~/org= folder. It looks like
 this:

#+caption: Org Capture Template for Jekyll Blog entry
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* NEXT %^{Title}
    :PROPERTIES:
    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: ~/play/superloopy.io/_posts/%<%Y-%m-%d>-draft-blog-post
    :END:
  ,#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
  ,#+BEGIN_HTML
  ---
  title: %\1
  layout: post
  abstract: %^{Abstract}
  tags: %^{Tags (comma separated)}
  ---
  ,#+END_HTML

  %\2

  %?
#+END_SRC

In my Emacs config I add an entry like this:

#+caption: Org Capture Template config entry
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("b" "Blog Post" entry (file+headline "Agenda.org" "Blog")
                 (file "tpl-blog-post.org") :empty-lines-before 1))
#+END_SRC

This means I can hit =C-c c b= and a buffer opens up prompting me for /Title/,
/Abstract/ and /Tags/, and have these inserted into a new entry. I can then
type a rough draft of my post. Hitting =C-c C-c= saves the draft to my
Agenda.org file under the /Blog/ heading.

When I've had a chance to review the nascent blog post I can export it to
HTML, from the Org Export Dispatcher: =C-c C-e=. I have to remember to select
/Body only/ by hitting =C-b= and usually /Export scope: Subtree/ by hitting
=C-s=, before I export to HTML with =h h=. Because of the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME=
property, Org puts the exported file directly into my Jekyll _posts directory,
where it will be picked up.

Because I end up checking in HTML source, rather than Org source it is not
entirely ideal if I then need to go back editing blog posts. But in my
experience I don't do that a lot. And if I /do/ then I should be able to find
my old source in my =~/org/Archive.org= file, where most deleted from
=~/org/Agenda.org= ends up. This directory is in iCloud Drive.

* Post-Abstract                                                    :noexport:

I share my Emacs & Org-mode setup for blogging with Jekyll.
