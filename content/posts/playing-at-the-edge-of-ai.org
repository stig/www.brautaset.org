Reading [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1558607838][Blondie24]], where I got the title of this post from, got me
exited about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network][neural nets]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm][genetic algorithms]] again. I always did
found them fascinating, but I didn't really have any practical use for
them myself---until now.

My goal for the Cocoa games project, and [[http://code.google.com/p/libggtl/][GGTL]] before it, has always
been to make building of decent computer game AIs very easy (for
two-player [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game][zero-sum]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information][perfect information]] games, at least, which is
actually a rather large group). My focus has been on the
scaffolding---encapsulating the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning][Alpha-Beta]] algorithm and letting
developers focus on implementing its key components: detecting legal
moves, applying a move to a state, and the evaluation function.

While the first two are quite uninteresting (they're just
/game-specific/ scaffolding), the evaluation function is what really
makes or breaks the resulting AI. Given an arbitrary state, this
function must determine its /fitness/; how good or bad the state is. If
you are an experienced player you might instinctively know if a given
state is good, but it may not be a simple task to translate that to
computer code. While computer games AIs have traditionally relied on
exploiting knowledge provided by human experts, David Fogel and Kumar
Chellapilla set out to see if they could create a program that could
learn to play checkers on its own. To achieve this they used a genetic
algorithm to evolve a neural net which they used as their program's
evaluation function.

David and Kumar were remarkably successful: Blondie learned to play
checkers to a human Master level. If I could reproduce their results in
a way that would work for a broader range of games, my goal of making
board-game AI creation very simple would be largely achieved.

Fast forward a few months. I have implemented a neural net evaluation
function for my Connect 4 game[fn::Now no longer available.]. The net
is somewhat simpler in construction than Blondie's, though I copied
the techniques used for evolving it straight from the book. After 25
generations I stopped the evolution and played a game against the best
neural net so far; it beat me hands down. Unfortunately, after 100
generations my best neural net still haven't been able to beat the
hand-rolled evaluation function I wrote for the game originally (I
must have had a stroke of genius back then).

This is where I am currently at. I don't want to release a game with an
AI inferior to that in the previous version, and I am currently
experimenting with a few possible ways to improve the training of the
neural net. Rest assured any progress I make will be the topic of future
posts.
