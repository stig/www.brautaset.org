#+title: Musical Goals January Update

#+category: Music

A month ago I wrote about my [[file:musical-goals-for-2019.org][musical goals for 2019]], where I rounded
off with my goals for January. I managed to put in 30-60 minutes
practice almost every day, and felt that it was a pretty productive
month. Here are those goals again:

1. Complete [[https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/grade-3-quickfire-test-et-306][Justin's Ear Training Grade 3]] and improve on my 75% score
   for his Quickfire test
2. Enquire at the local music shop about local people amenable to
   jamming / playing together
3. Finish Justin's beginner consolidation modules
4. Retire my current set list and pick some new songs to practice
5. Record AC/DC's "You Shook Me All Night Long"

I'm pleased to say that I managed to achieve all of them! Retiring my
"set list" (i.e. the songs I currently was growing tired of) obviously
didn't require much effort. Neither did finish Justin's consolidation
modules and Ear Training test, but they were important milestones for
me nonetheless. At my local music shop I learned [[https://www.artofblues.net/www.artofblues.net/Steve_Morrison-Welcome.html][Steve Morrison]] hosts
a local beginners Jam every week, and I'm really excited to give this
a try soon!

The standout item on the list was obviously recording myself playing.
I did a "first steps with GarageBand" around the middle of the month,
thinking I'd do another take at the end. In the end it took me so long
to do that I decided to not record again even though I know I did lots
of mistakes. (In particular the rhythm part during the start of the
solo is all wrong.) The recording is only to be able to track my
progress, after all. Nevertheless, I thought I'd share it.

As a bonus exercise I tried to transcribe the whole song. I used
[[http://lilypond.org/][LilyPond]], which is a Free Software music engraving program. I chose it
because the input files are plain text, so I can edit them using
Emacs. It can produce both traditional music notation and tabulature,
and also Midi output! Since I cannot read music all that well, I used
this to help me gauge whether I got the rhythm and notes right. It
took me a lot of work (10+ hours) to get the rhythm part done, and I
gave up adding the solo because of all the bends that I found LilyPond
doesn't support well.

* February Goals

  I've had a think about goals for next moth, and so far I've come up
  with this:


  1. Jam with others at least once (scheduled for the 6th!)
  2. Complete Justin's [[https://www.justinguitar.com/modules/effective-practice][Effective Practice Module]]
  3. Comfortably play the [[https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-find-a-note-exercise-mt-434][Note Finding Exercise]] for CGDAEBF @ 60bpm
  4. Play [[https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/how-to-practice-scales-sc-102][major scale pattern 1 in thirds]] at 160 bpm
  5. Learn, transcribe (rhythm part), and record [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGftIcp2SC0][Touch Too Much]] by AC/DC

The first of (hopefully) monthly posts with updates on my musical
goals for 2019. I cover achievements in January, and new goals for
February.
