My son and I have problems digesting dairy, so this dairy-free pudding
recipe that my wife drummed up has become a firm favourite.

Ingredients:

-  75g raisins
-  37.5g caster sugar
-  5-6 slices of bread
-  50g non-dairy margarine
-  1 tbsp demerara sugar for sprinkling
-  350ml Oatley
-  2 eggs
-  Seeds from 1/2 vanilla pod

Steps:

1. Use a little of the margarine to grease a 2-litre Pyrex dish. Gently
   melt the rest of the margarine in a pan. Once melted, set aside to
   cool. Meanwhile, mix raisins and caster sugar.

2. Cut off the crusts of the bread, and cut into broad strips. Dip
   strips of bread into the melted margarine and use them to create
   three layers in the dish: margarine side down for the bottom two
   layers---up for the top. Sprinkle the sugar and raisin mixture evenly
   between the layers.

3. Mix Oatley, eggs and vanilla seeds to form a custard. Pour the
   custard into the dish; make sure to fill all the nooks and crannies.

4. Sprinkle demerara sugar on top & let the pudding soak for 30 minutes.

5. Cook in oven at 180 degrees C for 35--40 minutes.
