#+title: Connectivity Galore
#+date: <2005-07-25>

I'm in Norway on holiday. I'm the resident tech.

My parents have an ISDN telephone, and ADSL internet connectivity. Now
they are changing to VOIP telephony, as this will give them free
national calls. Allegedly.

Going over their stash of connectivity voodoo (almost none of which was
hooked up to anything), I found:

-  1 ADSL over ISDN router
-  1 "normal" ADSL router
-  1 ADSL router with built-in wireless AP and 4-port switch
-  1 combined wireless AP & 4-port switch
-  1 VOIP box

The "normal" ADSL router arrived recently from their ADSL provider; it
is a replacement for the one with built-in wireless and switch, as these
have been showing stability issues. I've put it in place and hooked up
the stand-alone AP to it, so after some careful vetting of tech they now
have 2 ADSL routers to send back to their provider.

Gah!
