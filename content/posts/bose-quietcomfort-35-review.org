#+title: Bose QuietComfort 35 Review

Colleagues have asked numerous times about my experience with Bose
QuietComfort 35 noise-cancelling headphones. This post is me
re-posting my most recent response on my blog to save myself typing
the next time I'm asked.

* The good

- I love that they can connect to two devices via Bluetooth (both my
  phone and computer). This is important to avoid me missing phone
  calls if I'm connected to computer or meeting/slack notifications if
  I'm connected to the phone.

- They are particularly great for travel: it's like a 1st-class
  upgrade for airports, planes and trains.

- They're also pretty good at keeping me from hearing wife/son while
  working. Important as I work from home and my wife home educates our
  son.

- They can optionally work with a cable, and this doubles the battery
  life. (Which is already good.) If they run out of battery they
  continue to work as headphones, but you get no noise cancelling
  (obviously).

- Speaking of battery, they seem to charge in no time at all, and you
  get a spoken message about battery level every time you put them
  on - and a warning when they're getting low.

- They're very comfortable, even after 3 years use. (This in stark
  contrast to a previous pair of Shure ones I had where the ear pads
  hardened and became uncomfortable pretty quickly.)

- They fold up compactly into a superb travel case that protects them
  well.

* The bad

- The price.

- The sound quality for /listening to music/ specifically is not as good
  as the cheaper pair of Shure over-the-ear headphones I had.

- Not being able to hear anything that goes on around you when in a
  meeting can be a disadvantage.

- Their cost.

- For meetings the quality of the sound from the mic is not as good as
  a cheap headset (with a dedicated mic arm) I have.

- Also for meetings: the mic pick up keyboard and other ambient
  noises, but you can't hear it so you're not aware!

- It can be dangerous to wear them outside, as you can't hear traffic
  or other road users.

- They are expensive.

- They're not great in windy/draughty conditions. I think this is
  because they try to cancel out "phantom wind" that's blowing on the
  ambient mics.

- It's not possible to turn off the noise cancelling without plugging
  in a cable, which also turns off the Bluetooth.

- Did I mention they're not cheap?

* Verdict

For my use I think the good outweigh the bad, and if my QuietComfort
35s broke I would /consider/ getting them again. I'm not 100% sure
because I feel where they really shine (solo) air/train travel, and
I'm not sure the price is worth it given I so rarely travel nowadays.
* Abstract                                                         :noexport:

I review the noise-cancelling headphones I've been using for about 3 years.
