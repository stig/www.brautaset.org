#+title: No Smoking
#+date: <2007-07-01>

Nadia and I went to the Northgate, on the corner Northchurch road and
Southgate road, to celebrate the smoking ban finally kicking in across
England. It is not a moment too soon, and we've been looking forward to
it for ages.

Nadia had roast whole plaice with baby vegetables and champagne sauce,
while I went for halibut with lentils and green beans. Nadia found the
plaice a bit bland and under-cooked, while I really enjoyed the halibut.
It was dry in places and juicy in others, but very tasty all the way
through.

For dessert Nadia had chocolate grand marnier truffles with vanilla
cream, while I had vanilla panacotta with a berry compote. We ended up
eating about half of each other's, and we found that the dishes were a
/fantastic/ mix.

One downside was that they've stopped doing Peetermans, but this was
compensated a bit by me finding out that they had both Früli and
Kriek---albeit bottled.
