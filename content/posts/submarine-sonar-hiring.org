As some of you know I spent a year on a submarine. This is the story
about how that came about.

Norway has compulsory military service, and I wanted to make the best
of it. At my assessment & induction meeting I picked the Navy for
three main reasons:

- I thought I'd be able to sleep in a dry bed every night, instead of
  a wet sleeping bag. (This assumption was /almost/ correct.)
- I had heard submariners had the longest expected lifespan if
  deployed in a hostile situation.
- Thirdly I had seen the film [[https://itunes.apple.com/GB/movie/id211292501][The Hunt for Red October]] and for some
  reason the role of sonar operator on a submarine seemed really
  glamorous to me.

Everyone that enters the Norwegian Navy starts with six weeks basic
training on the same base. We received training, a fitness regime, and
lots of tests. I remember scoring 2/7 on my hearing test, and thought
my chance of becoming a sonar operator was now over.

At the end of my basic training I could finally apply to a specific
branch of the Navy. As I had expected, sonar operators on submarines
required hearing score of 7/7. But, what I hadn't expected was that
/every/ branch of the Navy required at least 3/7. I didn't qualify for
/anything/! Yet, I was told I had to pick _something_, and I thought I
might as well shoot for the stars. I applied to become a sonar
operator, and was accepted. I spent the next six weeks on a more
specific submarine training course.

- All submariners had to learn to escape from a submerged submarine
  through an airlock. We practised this in a 20-metre deep swimming
  pool at the base.
- We also had to memorise the location of all the valves on pipes
  penetrating the hull, so we could close these in an emergency.
- Sonar operators additionally have to learn to classify ships by the
  sound their propellers make. Is it a fishing boat, merchant-, or
  warship? And are they likely to be friend or foe?
- We also did more physical tests, including another hearing test
  which confirmed the result of the previous: my hearing was pretty
  bad. However, it was a bit more specific in /how/ it was bad[fn:1].

At the end of the six weeks we got to choose which submarine we wanted
to serve with. I had the highest score in the sonar operator test and
normally this meant I would get first pick. But, the officer in charge
seemed a bit hesitant and asked me: "wasn't there something wrong with
your hearing?" I didn't want to lie. But I also didn't want to
disqualify myself. I took a slight gamble and answered him with a
question: would I have managed to get the best score on the sonar
operator test if there was?

I guess that satisfied him, because instead of freezing my bottom off
in Norway the following winter I was on the first Norwegian submarine
to ever attend a NATO exercise in the Mediterranean.

When I wrote up this story I realised it confirmed a lesson relevant
to hiring: sometimes people will disqualify themselves from applying
to your job because they don't fulfil all the requirements in your
job ad. If I had qualified for /any/ of the other options available at
the end of my basic training I would have applied to that
instead.

So, I nearly didn't apply to become a sonar operator since I failed
the proxy requirement "has perfect score on generic hearing test".
However, the /real/ requirement was "can learn to classify boats by
their sound under water", and it turns out I was pretty good at that!

By putting unrealistic or inaccurate proxy requirements in your job ad
you are likely to get miss out on good candidates. You will be more
successful at hiring if you make sure what you put under the
Requirements heading in your job ad are actual /requirements/, and leave
anything negotiable under the "nice to have" section.

Let's finish off with an example. If you're hiring a driver it might
make sense to require candidates have a valid driver's licence. Throw
in a line about advanced driving qualifications too, if you're hiring
a getaway driver. That candidates must be martial artists and have a
passing likeness to Jason Statham is heavily in "nice to have"
territory though, unless you are the casting director for the next
instalment of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transporter_(franchise)][The Transporter]] franchise.

[fn:1] They split my hearing range in low and high register for each
ear, so four in total. I had poor response to one frequency in each of
these "quadrants", but otherwise normal hearing.

This is a transcript of a lightning talk I gave at a company "all
hands" get-together. I tell the story of my "hiring experience" as a
sonar operator on a submarine in the Norwegian Navy. To tie it into
work, I included a little hiring-related lesson at the end.
