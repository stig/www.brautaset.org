#+title: Electoral Reform Now!

In the 2017 UK General Election the Conservatives got just over 6
percent more of the votes than Labour, but got 21 percent more
MPs ([[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2017/results][source]]). The Scottish Nationalist Party got fewer than half the
votes of the Liberal Democrats---yet got nearly three times the MPs.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) got ten MPs, with a little more
than half the Green Party's votes (1 MP)---and a little less than half
of UKIP's (0---zero!---MPs).

This is not fair. This is not a good representation of the electorate.
This is the result of the [[https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/first-past-the-post/][First Past the Post]] (FPTP) voting system
used in UK General Elections---and in many former British colonies.
This needs to change. We need to improve our democratic process and
ensure that every vote counts.

One way to redress this imbalance between vote ratio and MPs is to
switch to a system of proportional representation (PR). In the table
below I've calculated what the number of MPs would be for each party
if we used PR. Note that I've rounded up to the nearest MP, as
electing 76% of an MP could be deeply traumatic for those involved and
could discourage people from standing. (You could just as well round
down and get a slightly lower number of MPs.)

One challenge is to get a good balance of MPs with a local connection
to the area they represent, and proportionate representation for the
country as a whole. Another toughie---at least for me personally---is
that under proportional representation UKIP would have 12 MPs. But
this is the cost of democracy: we cannot simply silence the voices we
don't like.

The [[https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk][Electoral Reform Society]] is the UK's leading voice for democratic
reform. They have a list of [[https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/][voting systems]] on their website, several
of which addresses this. The biggest challenge they face, however, is
to get /any/ proportional system through Parliament---given the
incumbent party would lose out massively. Nevertheless, I think it's
important to try.

I try to show how unjust the First Past the Post system used to elect
MPs in UK General Elections is.
