#+title: Saw 25% faster!
#+date: <2008-09-20>

Today I bought a new saw at the local hardware store. It's an [[http://www.irwin.dk/pdf/IR_JA_LIT_KFS_880_300dpi_4C.pdf][Irwin
Universal 880 Triple Ground]] handsaw. It, as the name suggests,
features a new triple ground tooth design that makes it /25% faster/
than the double ground version. It was pretty cheap too, at Â£7.99.

I was quite excited about it, but felt a bit sheepish---like I was
exploring an entirely new ballpark of sadness---until I actually tried
the thing. It's a /delight/ to use compared to my old saw. It cut
through my chip-wood shelf like a knife through hot butter.

OK, still feeling /a little/ bit bad about being so excited about a saw.
I'm sure I'll get over it.
