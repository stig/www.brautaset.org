#+title: Speeding up tests on CircleCI for a Python Django project
#+category: Python
#+category: CircleCI

My employer uses CircleCI to run tests for each change before merging
to the main branch. Faster tests means faster feedback cycles, which
means you can ship more often. Shipping more often in turn means you
gain more confidence shipping---it's a virtuous cycle.

* Introduction

  In April the tests for one such Python Django application's PR
  workflow took about 13 minutes to run on CircleCI. We aimed to
  reduce this time to under 10 minutes. Picture [[april]] shows the most
  expensive part of our workflow at the start of our story.

** What did the workflow /do/?

   The =build= job created a Docker image, containing only runtime
   dependencies[fn::We don't want to add test dependencies to the base
   image, as in our deploy jobs (not discussed here) we deploy this on
   ElasticBeanstalk.]. It dumped this to a file with =docker save=, and
   persisted it in the workspace. The two tests jobs[fn::We deploy this
   application in two separate configurations with different feature
   sets. Each profile runs all the tests, except a small
   portion---about 10%---only applicable to the other profile.]
   restored the base image from the workspace. They built on this to
   create an image with all the extra modules required to run the
   tests. They then started dependencies, and ran the tests.

   Doing shared setup once, then /fan-out/, is a time-honoured way to
   reduce resource usage. However our fan-out steps were expensive:

   - Issuing =docker save= to dump the built image to a file took around
     30 seconds, and [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#persist_to_workspace][persisting it to the workspace]] added another 60.

   - The test jobs then had to [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#attach_workspace][attach the workspace]] and load the base
     image, adding 30 seconds.

   - Our test jobs started dependencies (Redis, Cassandra, and
     PostgreSQL) with =docker-compose=. This required us to use the
     [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/][machine executor]], which added about 30-60 second startup overhead
     compared to the docker executors.

   - Because the base image from the =build= job contained only runtime
     dependencies, we had to build a /test/ docker image, extending the
     base to add dependencies for testing. Another 70-ish seconds.

   That's adds up to a lot of time /not yet/ running tests! Roughly half
   of the total time, in fact: when the tests finally started, they
   completed in about 6 minutes 30 seconds.

** Why was workspace interaction so slow?

   Our base image is big! I think mainly because the Docker =python:2=
   image we started with is /already/ big. This has a knock-on effect on
   saving to, and restoring from, the workspace.

* Analysis

  It is possible we could have sped up the workspace interaction steps
  by basing our Dockerfiles on a slimmer =python:2= image. However this
  would change what we deploy, and what engineers use locally. We
  preferred to avoid that this time. (Although this is still on the
  table for speeding up our /deploy/ jobs.)

  Our CircleCI PR workflow mimicked how most of our engineers used
  =docker-compose= for local development: building a service image with
  all runtime dependencies, and a test image that extended that with
  tests and test dependencies. Using =docker-compose= was not required,
  however. It was possible to run the tests directly with Tox---indeed
  our Dockerfiles did this.

  In a CI context you want to run all the tests in a freshly created
  environment with all the latest dependencies. Locally you won't
  typically create a new virtualenv and install dependencies anew
  every time you run tests, and you're more likely to cherry-pick
  relevant tests to run than run them all every time.

* Remediation steps

  We changed the CI test workflow to no longer depend on building the
  base image[fn::We still build it, because we want to verify that we
  can. It is after all used in our deploy workflow still. But we no
  longer need to save it to disk, nor persist it to the workspace in
  our PR workflow.]. We also changed our test jobs to launch
  auxiliary services using CircleCI's docker executor native [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker--machine--macosexecutor][service
  container support]] (rather than =docker-compose=), and run =tox= from
  the main container to install dependencies and run tests. This
  avoids minutes of saving the image to---and restoring it from---our
  workspace. It also eliminated the extra startup-cost of the =machine=
  executor.

  Installing dependencies in the primary container on CircleCI, rather
  than relying on our Dockerfile, also allowed us to use [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-python/#cache-dependencies][CircleCI's
  caching]] to speed up virtualenv creation[fn::In contrast to their
  example, however, we cache only PIP downloads, rather than the
  fully-built virtualenv. This to avoid any contamination that could
  creep into the virtualenv over time.]. We didn't have access to this
  shared cache when installing dependencies into our docker images,
  but now it saved about 90 seconds when building the virtualenvs.

  So far we've cut down the time /preparing/ to run tests. Could we
  speed up the running of the tests themselves? On CI we don't need to
  keep the DB after test runs. Thus we replaced the DB image we used
  for tests with an [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/databases/][in-memory Postgres image]], that doesn't save to
  disk. This gave a modest reduction in test run time.

  Finally we moved to running the tests in parallel, using Django's
  test runner. At first this resulted in lots of test failures related
  to our Cassandra integration[fn::I then tried using CircleCI's [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/parallelism-faster-jobs/#splitting-test-files][test
  splitting]] instead. This showed promise, but it had problems: it was
  difficult to achive an even split of the test files, since Django's
  test runner only accepts test module names. However, it prompted one
  of my colleagues to take a hard look at /why/ the tests failed when
  running in parallel using Django's native method.], but a couple of
  my colleagues were able to fix the problem. (As well as the new
  problem introduced by the first fix!) After a bit of trial and error
  we settled on running the tests in parallel across 3 CPUs[fn::By
  default CircleCI gives you only 2 CPUs, but by upgrading to their
  new [[https://circleci.com/pricing/usage/][Performance Plan]] we were able to specify different [[https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class][resource
  classes]] for our jobs. This plan even saves us about one third off
  our monthly CircleCI bill! How? We hate queueing and on the old plan
  paid CircleCI for many containers. Most of our engineers are
  primarily based in one region, and all the containers were idle at
  night and all weekend. Paying only for what we /use/ makes so much
  more sense!].

  Figure [[june]] shows the result of the above steps. The workflow now
  completes comfortably in under four minutes---sometimes closer to
  three. Less time than the old workflow spent /preparing/ to start
  running the tests!

* Conclusion

  Speeding up our CI test runs was an exciting challenge that required
  a multi-pronged approach. There was no single change that gave a
  massive reduction on its own. Running tests in parallel, for
  example, would not have helped much when we spent most of the time
  /preparing/ to run the tests.

  The key came from recognising the differences between running tests
  in a CI vs local context. With this we were comfortable nudging our
  CI setup towards playing to the strengths of the CircleCI platform.
  This allowed us to iterate and unlock ways to improve test run time.
