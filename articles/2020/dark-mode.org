A /really/ short post about adding Dark Mode to this site.

Following [[https://kevq.uk/how-to-add-css-dark-mode-to-a-website/][Kev Quirk's instructions]], I've added an automatic Dark Mode
to this site, if your browser requests it. I'd never heard of the
possibility until reading Kev's post, but I understand pretty much all
modern browsers support it. It was pretty simple to add, so thank you
Kev for the clear & simple instructions!

Here's a side-by-side comparison of my current Dark and Light modes:

@@html:<div class="row"><div class="column">@@

#+attr_html: :alt Dark Mode
[[file:dark-mode.png]]

@@html:</div><div class="column">@@

#+attr_html: :alt Light Mode
file:light-mode.png

@@html:</div></div>@@

I had to set the colours for my normal Light Mode theme using CSS
variables, and then reset these variables to different colours using
the following CSS media query ~prefers-color-scheme: dark~. I've tested
that it works for my site on macOS with the current version of Firefox
& Safari, and in mobile Safari on iOS.

The thing I like /best/ about the exercise is not the Dark Mode itself,
but that the process of adding it improved the Light Mode version of
my theme too! The default colours I relied on for links were
unreadable in Dark Mode, so I had to change them. This forced me to
consider what they should be in Light Mode too, and the result looks
more cohesive in my opinion.
