You know the feeling: you're at your desk, planet-sized brain poring
over some code through your beady browns. Then out of the blue somebody
arrives with a can of worms, and there can be no mistake: it's got your
name written on it. It's yours.

This happened to me at work today. It wasn't your regular baked-bean tin
either. No, sir! It was a large green plastic container. With a carrying
handle. Subsidised by the council, even. And not to forget: my name on
the shipping label.

Normally I'd kicked the bucket at this point, but today it was a
pleasant surprise. I did not expect my new wormery until tomorrow.

It's a wonderful thing. I think. I'll feed it leftover food, cardboard,
egg-shells, dust-rabbits, and the contents of my Dyson; in return, the
little crawlies inside will produce excellent compost for my plants.
