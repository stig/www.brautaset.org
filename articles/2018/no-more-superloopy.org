Why this site is moving from the superloopy.io domain to brautaset.org.
#+end_abstract

I've decided to end the experiment with a separate vanity domain
(superloopy.io) for this site. =.io= domains are expensive, and I don't
want to pay for one any longer. And more to the point, I don't want to
pay for more than one vanity domain. Since I've been using the
brautaset.org domain for my email for nearly two decades it was a
pretty easy choice to keep that one.

I'm still [[../2017/publishing-this-blog-to-s3.org][deploying to S3]], and still using CloudFormation to set up S3
buckets, SSL Certificates and CloudFront distributions.  For the next
6 months I'll redirect requests to www.brautaset.org.
