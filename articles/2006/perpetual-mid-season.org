#+title: Perpetual mid-season

Sainsbury's were out of their nice orange juice so we had to buy
Tropicana instead. Eating breakfast and reading the back of the carton I
found this:

  So every day a mile long Tropicana train travels over a thousand miles
  from lush, green groves to New York laden with just-squeezed juice.
  Naturally pure, and squeezed from only the choicest oranges, each one
  handpicked at its mid-season best.

How curious. That is either a very liberal use of the word "just" or
those green groves have /remarkably/ short pre and post seasons.
