#+title: About Stig Brautaset

I'm an experienced software engineer,
working remotely from the North East of England.
I've previously worked in London and Hong Kong.
Employers have paid me to write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Scala,
Python, Bash and English.

I'm from Hovdebygda, in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsta][Ã˜rsta]],
on the west coast of Norway.
I studied electronics,
and endured compulsory military service as a
sonar operator on a submarine, before moving to London to study AI at
the University of Westminster. I graduated in 2003.

* About SBJson

  I started writing the popular [[https://github.com/stig/json-framework/][SBJson]] JSON parser/generator for
  Objective-C in 2007, and have maintained it ever since. It's now in
  its 5th major version and have over 3800 stars on GitHub.

* About this website

  I build this website in Emacs' Org mode, which can publish static
  HTML files. Those I deploy on Amazon S3 behind a CloudFront
  distribution and a free SSL certificate.

  Code examples are by me, unless otherwise specified, and available
  under the [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/][Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)]]

  If you want to contact me about one of my software projects I ask
  that you do so by filing an issue on [[https://github.com/stig][GitHub]].

  Otherwise the best way of contacting me is via email. I used to give
  my email address here, but in a (most likely futile) attempt to
  limit spam I've removed it. Don't worry: I'm sure you'll be able to
  figure it out.
